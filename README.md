# Color-Gradiant-Generator
A chrome extension that I've finished lately, and it's for generating color Gradiants from putting the wanted color and the mode 
and copying it to the clipboard when clicking on any color 
I've used vanila javascript because of the simplicity of the project 
There are two mods in the extension Dark and Light for those who prefer Dark mode
